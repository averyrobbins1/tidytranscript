# tidytranscript

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of tidytranscript is to make it easy to scrape data from BYU-Idaho student transcripts.

## Installation

You can install the package available on [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("averyrobbins1/tidytranscript")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to read in a transcript and get a student's major:

```{r example, eval = FALSE}
library(tidytranscript)
dat <- read_transcript('data/my_transcript.pdf')
scrape_major(dat)
```

The main scraping functions are the following:
- `scrape_major` - returns a student's major
- `scrape_birthday` - returns a student's birthday
- `scrape_earned_credits` - returns the total amount of credits earned by the student,
including both transfer credits and credits acquired while at BYU - Idaho
- `scrape_grades` - returns only those grades earned at BYU - Idaho (transfer grades were not important for our use case. If desired, feel free to figure that out and submit a pull request.)

To make life easier, all of the necessary functions have been compiled into one master function `tidytranscript::tidytranscript`. Simply input the path to the appropriate PDF and scrape all of the desired data in one go. Below we are also using the function `get_example_file` to *ahem* get the example file to use for this example. Example example example.

```{r}
library(tidytranscript)
my_file <- get_example_file()
dat <- tidytranscript(my_file)
head(dat)
```



## Important Note

This package is only designed to scrape data from transcripts of the following PDF format:
